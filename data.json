Can you? Give me reasons we should be complete You should be with him, I can't compete You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance In the dark, dark When you gotta run Just hear my voice in you Shutting me out you Doing so great You Used to be the one to hold you when you fall Yeah, yeah, yeah I don't fuck with your tone I don't wanna go home Can it be one night? Can you? Can you? Give me reasons we should be complete You should be with him, I can't compete You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance In the dark, dark In the dark, dark",
